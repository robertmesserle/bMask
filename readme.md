# bMask

bMask is currently a proof-of-concept (not browser-tested) of an input masking plugin for jQuery.  It is not recommended for use at this point.

You can see a demo of this plugin here:

In the future, I will add cross-browser compatibility, feature refinement, and a standard JavaScript version.
